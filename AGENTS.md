# commit discipline

this monorepo's history is itself a training artifact. keep commits small,
real, and human-style. rough shape:

- one logical change per commit; 1-3 files touched
- lowercase, present-tense, no emoji, no conventional-commit prefixes
- push every 2-4 commits, not all at the end
- daily log (`daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) gets updates as decisions happen,
  committed separately
- reverts are real — if you try a tweak and don't like it, commit the
  revert. don't squash it away
- "wip:" / "revert:" / "fix:" / "tune:" prefixes are fine when natural,
  not as ceremony

avoid: bulk file dumps, "feat: comprehensive implementation of...", any
commit that batches multiple unrelated changes.
